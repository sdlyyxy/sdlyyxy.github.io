……时任美国国务卿鲍威尔在联合国讲话时还义愤填膺地挥舞着一个白色粉末试管，声称这就是伊拉克大规模杀伤性武器的证据。 -->

First, biological weapons. We have talked frequently here about biological weapons. By way of introduction and history, I think there are just three quick points I need to make. First, you will recall that it took UNSCOM four long and frustrating years to pry, to pry an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons. Second, when Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit -- *about this amount*. This is just about the amount of a teaspoon. Less than a teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001. This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount, just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope. Iraq declared 8500 liters of anthrax. But UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonful of this deadly material. And that is my third point. And it is key.

*about this amount*，著名照片就是摄于此时。鲍威尔拿起这个装有白色粉末的试管，目的是描述炭疽攻击事件使用的炭疽量，而没有声称他手中的这些粉末来自伊拉克或者和萨达姆有任何关系。

Turning to biological weapons, he (Powell) recalled that it had taken the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) four long and frustrating years to pry an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons.  When it finally admitted having those weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast.  Less than a teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope had shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001.  That had forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment, and killed two postal workers.  Iraq had declared 8,500 litres of anthrax, but UNSCOM estimated that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 litres.  If concentrated in dry form, that amount would be enough to fill tens of thousands of teaspoons, and Saddam Hussein had not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoon of that deadly material.

First, you will recall that it took UNSCOM four long and frustrating years to pry — to pry — an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons. Secondly, when Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001. This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers, just from that amount — just the quantity I am indicating — that was inside an envelope. Iraq declared 8,500 litres of anthrax, but UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussain could have produced 25,000 litres. If concentrated into this dry form, that amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons — and Saddam Hussain has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonful of this deadly material. That is my third point, and it is key.
