"*A Mathematical Theory of Communication*" is an article by mathematician Claude E. Shannon published in *Bell System Technical Journal* in 1948. It was renamed *The Mathematical Theory of Communication* in the 1949 book of the same name, a small but significant title change after realizing the generality of this work. It became one of the most cited of all scientific articles and gave rise to the field of information theory.

The communiqué concludes with the Party and the people looking forward to achieving "even greater glories and victories on the new journey… in the new era."

Note the subtle change from "*a* New Era" to "*the* New Era"; this "a-to-the" change sends the deep message that the Sixth Plenum has now canonized "the New Era" as a formal part of official Party history.
