[央广网上海3月27日消息](https://www.cnr.cn/shanghai/tt/20230327/t20230327_526196950.shtml)（记者唐奇云）3月27日，一则关于“上海徐汇中学一女生戴假发进入男浴室偷拍”的录音视频在网上流传。该录音视频显示，偷拍事件发生后，同班18名男学生联名举报，却遭到女教师反对阻止。

此事爆出后，许多关注了最近新闻的网友要求公安机关和学校依[苏州大学事件](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1760762779272280302)、[南华大学事件](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1760968490712291820)、[南通大学事件](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1761208134049408791)等例处理，否则就是「双重标准」。说到双重标准，我想起了《哈利·波特》中的一个精彩片段……

*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:*

> 'I wonder if Hermione's seen this yet?' Harry said, looking round at the door to the girls' dormitories.  
> 'Let's go and tell her,' said Ron. He bounded forwards, pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase.  
> He was on the sixth stair when there was a loud, wailing, klaxon-like sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide like a helter-skelter. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry's feet.  
> 'Er - I don't think we're allowed in the girls' dormitories,' said Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh.  
> Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.  
> 'Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?' they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron.  
> 'Me,' said Ron, who was still rather dishevelled. 'I didn't realise that would happen. **It's not fair!**' he added to Harry, as the girlsheaded off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. '**Hermione's allowed in our dormitory, how come we're not allowed -?**'  
> 'Well, it's an old-fashioned rule,' said Hermione, who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, 'but it says in Hogwarts: A History, that **the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls**. Anyway, why were you trying to get in there?'  
> 'To see you - look at this!' said Ron, dragging her over to the noticeboard.  
> Hermione's eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her expression became stony.

罗琳想表达什么？不知道。但我觉得霍格沃茨创始人在这里的双重标准……没啥问题？
