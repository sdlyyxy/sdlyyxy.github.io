前段时间，看到了英语单词“shanghai”的有趣意思：
> 1 a :to put aboard a ship by force often with the help of liquor or a drug<br>
b :to put by force or threat of force into or as if into a place of detention<br>
2 :to put by trickery into an undesirable position<br>
（以酒或麻醉剂）使（某人）失去知觉然后拐带至出航的船上做水手；骗（某人）入困境。

Origin:

>In the 1800s, long sea voyages were very difficult and dangerous, so people were understandably hesitant to become sailors. But sea captains and shipping companies needed crews to sail their ships, so they gathered sailors any way they could—even if that meant resorting to kidnapping by physical force or with the help of liquor or drugs. The word shanghai comes from the name of the Chinese city of Shanghai. People started to use the city's name for that unscrupulous way of obtaining sailors because the East was often a destination of ships that had kidnapped men onboard as crew.

Examples:

>Nate was *shanghaied* by his sister into helping her sell shirts at the lacrosse tournament after her friend bailed out.
 
>"In time, the new novel, lurching around his psyche, dragged itself away and became real. How I loved to see him *shanghaied* like that, careening down the rum-soaked wharves of imagination…."
